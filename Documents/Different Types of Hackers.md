## Different Types of Hackers

### Red Hat (Vigilante Hacking)

A red hat hacker could refer to someone who targets Linux systems. Red hats, like white hats, seek to disarm black hat hackers but the two groups' methodologies are significantly different. Rather than handing the black hat hacker over to the authorities, red hats will launch aggressive attacks against them to bring them down, often destroying the black hat's computer and resources.

### White Hat (Ethical Hacking)

A white hat hacker is a security specialist who is hired to find exploits within a computer system and report them to the person or company who hired them to be fixed. White hat hacking is legal.

### Black Hat (Unethical Hacking)

A black hat hacker is someone who has malicious intent, they search for an exploit on a computer system, often using malware, trojans and other hacking techniques to cause harm. Black hat hacking is illegal.

### Grey Hat (Neutral Hacking)

A grey hat hacker is a fusion between a White hat and Black hat hacking, they find exploits within a computer system, sometimes using illegal methods but without malicious intent but they will either release the exploits into the public domain to be fixed or sell them to make a profit like a black hat hacker. Grey hat hackers often hack computer systems without the permission or knowledge of the system's owner.
