#### 6. Tool Support for Testing

##### Test Tools:

A test tool is a software product that supports one or more test activities, such as planning and control, specification, building initial files and data, test execution and tests.

###### Benefits:

- Improves the efficiency of test activities
- Automate activities that require significant resources when done manually
- Automate activities that cannot be executed manually

###### Risks:

- Unrealistic expectations for the tool
- Underestimating effort for the initial introduction
- Underestimating effort to achieve significant benefits
- Efforts to maintain the test assets
- Over-reliance on the tool
- Neglecting version control
- Risk of suspension of open-source/ free tool projects

##### Effective use of Tools:

###### The Main Principles of Tool Selection

- Organisational maturity
- Clear requirements and objective criteria
- Vendor support
- Coaching and mentoring internal requirements
- Training needs
- Cost-benefit ratio
- A proof-of-concept

###### Pilot Projects for Introducing a Tool into an Organisation

- learn more detail about the tool
- Evaluate how the tool fits with existing processes
- Decide on a standard way of using the tool
- Asset cost vs benefits

###### Success Factors for Tools:

- Rolling out tools incrementally
- Adapting and improving processes
- Providing training, coaching and mentoring
- Defining usage guidelines
- Gather usage information
- Monitoring tool use and benefits
- Providing support
