## XML and JSON



#### Extensible Mark-up Language (XML)

XML is a text-based mark-up language derived from standard generalized mark-up language(SGML). XML tags identify the data and are used to store and organise the data, rather than specifying how to display it like HTML tags, which are used to display the data. XML is not going to replace HTML but it introduces new possibilities by adopting many successful features of HTML. There are three important characteristics of XML that make it useful in a variety of systems and solutions, these are:

- XML is Extensible:
  - XML allows you to create your own self-descriptive tags, or languages, that suit your application.
- Carries the data and does not present it:
  - XML allows you to store the data irrespective of how it will be presented.
- Public Standard:
  - XML was developed by an organisation called the WWW Consortium and is available as an open standard.



#### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularised by Douglas Crockford. Even though it closely resembles JavaScript, it can be used independently and many programming environments feature the ability to read(parse) and generate JSON. JSON exists as a string, useful when you want to transmit data across a network. It needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object when you want to access the data. This is not a big issue, JavaScript provides a global JSON object that has methods available for converting between the two.
