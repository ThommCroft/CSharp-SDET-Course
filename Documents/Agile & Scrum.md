## Agile & Scrum



#### Agile

The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is vital, both with team members and project stakeholders.

Agile's four main values are:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan



#### Scrum

Scrum is an Agile development methodology used in the development of software based on an iterative and incremental process. Scrum is an adaptive, fast, flexible and effective agile framework that is designed to deliver value to the customer throughout the development of the project. The primary objective of scrum is to satisfy the customer's needs through an environment of transparency in communication, collective responsibility and continuous progress. The development starts from a general idea of what needs to be built, elaborating a list of characteristics ordered by priority (Product Backlog) that the owner of the product wants to obtain.

User Stories are created with Acceptance criteria before the Product Backlog is obtained to start the development in the first sprint of the project. At the end of each sprint, a review is taken of how it went and want needs to be done and then the process is started again for the next phase of development.
