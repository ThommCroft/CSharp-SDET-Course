     * Add another service class to your testing project - this one should call the `Lookup Outward Code` using `GET`. Add a test class and test various aspects of the response.
     * Make sure you read the documentation on https://postcodes.io/ and test the lookup on Postman. You don't need to test all the response - what tests would be most efficient?
     * Then look at the other `postcodes.io` endpoints and methods. Pick a few (perhaps the bulk lookup `POST` endpoint) and write a service class and a test class for each.
     * 
     * Think about Sad paths.
     * 
     * Optional - repeat with bulk post code.
